# Project 1: Weather-App

You have to start somewhere! My first React project - simple, stylish... well, merely usefull, but working!

## Features

- Type a city name to check today's weather and the weather forecast for 6 days;
- You can switch between Fahrenheit and Celsius;
- Error pop-up shows if the city is typed wrong;
- Submit button is disabled if input field is empty.

## Skills used

- React
- Sass/Scss
- Git + Bash

## What did I learn

- Making **independent** and **reusable** components;
- Making HTTP requests using **Axios**;
- Using SCSS and **modules**;
- Creating **responsive layouts**.
- Using **libraries** (e.g. "classnames", "react-animated-weather")
